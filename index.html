			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			Hello.  I am an experienced tutor presently offering comprehensive tutoring in middle- and high-school level Math subjects up to and including precalculus.  I have a passion for numerous subjects, including Mathematics, Computer Science and the Life Sciences.  I am eager to lend my talent and experience in what promises to be an unprecedented 2020 back-to-school season both for parents and students.  I hope to hear from you and wish you luck towards achieving your academic aspirations!

			<h2>Cool Fact</h2>
			<p>Without the context of concrete, real-world examples, the abstract nature of Math can flummox even the most precocious students; that is why I prioritize application-based study of the high school Math curriculum.

		<div id="experience">
			<h2>Past Experience</h2>
			   <p>With substantial experience tutoring computer science and digital media, with my first tutee subject being Math, my methodology involves building on my existing repertoire to match studentsâ€™ curiosity and curricular priorities.  I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from The New School in New York City, where I self-directed a course of study weaving together Environmental Science, New Media and Food Studies. I have also worked as a Digital Media Lab Consultant and taken coursework at the University of Pennsylvania. I have received %100 5-star ratings on VarsityTutors.com.

			<h2>Individualized Focus</h2>
			<p>Understanding that students usually have their own distinct style of learning, I conduct every session taking the student's unique intellectual character into account.
