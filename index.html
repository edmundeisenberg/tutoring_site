			<h2>Professional Tutor</h2>
			<p>
			Hello.  I am an experienced tutor presently offering comprehensive tutoring in middle- and high-school level Math subjects up to and including precalculus.  My favorite part of tutoring is connecting with my client over a common interest in the subject being studied. My methodology involves building on my existing repertoire to match studentsâ€™ curiosity and curricular priorities. I am eager to lend my talent and experience in what promises to be an unprecedented 2020 back-to-school season both for parents and students.

			<h2>Past Experience</h2>
			   <p>Having first tutored Math in Middle School as a public service project for my Bar Mitzvah, I have tutored Computer Science professionally since 2019.  I have also worked as a Digital Media Lab Consultant while studying at the University of Pennsylvania. I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from The New School in New York City and have several years experience as a sound engineer in several all-ages music venues.

			<h2>Cool Fact</h2>
			<p>Without the context of concrete, real-world examples, the abstract nature of Math can flummox even the most precocious students; that is why I prioritize application-based study of the high school Math curriculum.

		<div id="about">
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			I have numerous professional passions including writing, robotics and food.  My main area of interest, besides education, is Biomedical Science. I am currently seeking a research position in the focus of Structural Biology and, thereafter, plan to continue my education in that area.

			<h2>Individualized Focus</h2>
			<p>Understanding that students usually have their own distinct style of learning, I conduct every session taking the student's unique intellectual character into account.
