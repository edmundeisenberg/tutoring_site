			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			Hello.  I am an experienced tutor with a background catering to both high school and college students as well as professionals seeking to advance in their careers. I have a strong knowledge-base in new media and life sciences and am eager to build on my existing repertoire to match studentsâ€™ curiosity and curricular priorities. I am eager to lend my talent and experience in what promises to be an unprecedented 2020 back-to-school season both for parents and students.  I hope to hear from you!

			<h2>Past Experience</h2>
			   <p>With the bulk of my experience being in computer science and media methods, I have a passion for numerous subjects, including French language and literature, Life Science and Music Theory. I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from The New School in New York City, where I self-directed a course of study that encompassed Environmental Science, New Media and Food Studies. I have received exceptionally high ratings from my previous clients.  Understanding that students usually have their own distinct learning-styles, I value	 the process of tailoring unique approaches to subject matter.  I would be happy to provide any further details upon request.
