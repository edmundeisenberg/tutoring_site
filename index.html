				<h2>Cool Fact:</h2>
				<p>One common obstacle to High School level math is connecting mathematical concepts to concrete, real-world phenomena; that is why I prioritize contextual comprehension of the math curriculum.</p>

			<h2>Past Experience</h2>
			   <p>With substantial experience tutoring computer science and digital media, I am currently focused on building on my existing repertoire to match studentsâ€™ curiosity and curricular priorities.  I hold a BA in Liberal Arts from The New School in New York City, where I self-directed a course of study that encompassed Environmental Science, New Media and Food Studies. I have also worked as a Media Lab Consultant and taken coursework at the University of Pennsylvania. I have received consistent 5-star ratings on VarsityTutors.com.
